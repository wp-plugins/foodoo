Adds the FooDoo link icon to all posts/recipes, for getting ingredients in a shopping list in the FooDoo mobile app.

== Description ==
This plugin automatically inserts the FooDoo link icon on all posts/recipes on the blog that is available in the mobile app FooDoo.
If the recipe has a headline saying \"Ingredients\", the icon will be placed right next to it, or else it will be placed at the bottom of the recipe - see screenshots for examples.
When the user clicks the icon, a new tab is opened with the FooDoo webpage where the user can then scan the QR code with the app to automatically get the recipe right in the app.

With the FooDoo app you can easily get a shopping list for a recipe that you would like to make. The FooDoo shopping list makes it a seamless experience going to the supermarket to shop the ingredients.
